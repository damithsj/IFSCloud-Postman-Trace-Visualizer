# Postman Visualizer for IFS Cloud Projection trace

You can get the IFS trace data for a projection call by adding the query parameter `odata-debug`.
This will add the trace information in `ifs-trace` node of the response message. Since the trace data is in JSON format, it's hard to interpert the information using tools like Postman.

[Postman Visualizer](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/visualizer/) is a good tool where you can visually represent the request responses. Here you can find a visualizer script for representing IFS trace information in readable format in Postman.

### How to Use
- [x] Create a new Postman Collection
- [X] Add a new request to the collection, and use any IFS projection call.
- [X] Go to the **Tests** tab of the collection
- [X] Copy the code from [src/postman-visualizer-ifscloud-trace.js](src/postman-visualizer-ifscloud-trace.js) and paste in the Postman Tests. You can add the test script to the collection if there are many requests.
- [X] Make sure the query parameter `odata-debug` is included in the request.

Eg: `{{ifs_url}}/main/ifsapplications/projection/v1/YOUR_PROJECTION_CALL?odata-debug=json`
- [X] Go to the **Visualize** tab in the response. Trace information can be seen in readable format.
